# Chat app using websockets (Nodejs, Express & Socket.io) withour DATABASE 
For me this task was very useful and it was be challangeful. i did not heard about redis prisma and do not know database. when i took project, i started backend topic and desired to be backend developer. if i finish all topics (docker redis nestjs socket), i will do project in a high level.
